This repo contains customized functions that allow you to train models for satellital imagery by data mining images from earth engine. The user needs a query with layer coordinates.

### **Instructions**
1 - follow the notebooks instructions, which manage different stages.First notebook is used for data mining. 
2 - Second notebook is used for training the models from a .jpeg collection. Therefore, both notebooks are indepdendant and can be used separately. <br>
Note: You will need to have an active earth engine account and an active project to connect for the data mining process. https://earthengine.google.com/
Note: Following the oficial earthengine api is recommended as complementay source code: https://github.com/google/earthengine-api

### **Advantages and unique value:**

- Use data mining and train geospatial models all in one! Try this computer vision experiment. you can choose the pre-trained suggested models from tensorflow and pytorch or use your own models.
